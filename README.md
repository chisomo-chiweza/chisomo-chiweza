- 👋&#127997; Hi, I’m @chisomo-chiweza - a Malawian polyglot programmer (🇲🇼).
- 💖 This is my professional Github account. I'm currently a systems development intern @NBS-BANK.
- 🛠️  Whilst I like to explore what I can build with different programming languages - I've also been interested lately in how I can engineer better software..
- 👀 To have an idea of what programming languages I'm playing with - you can check out my [exercism profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/mwprogrammer).
- 📫 If you're interested in making a professional connection, connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chisomochiweza). If you just want to say hello to a fellow programmer, follow my personal Github account [@mwprogrammer](https://github.com/mwprogrammer).
