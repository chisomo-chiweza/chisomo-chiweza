- 👋 Hi, I’m @chisomo-chiweza - a Malawian polyglot programmer (🇲🇼).
- ❤️ To have an idea of what programming languages I'm playing with - you can check out my [exercism profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/mwprogrammer). 
- 👀 Whilst I love seeing what I can build with different programming languages, I'm also primarily interested in software engineering.
- 🌱 This is my professional account. I'm currently a systems development intern @NBS-BANK.
